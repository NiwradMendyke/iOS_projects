Here is the first app for the iOS training course. 

Version 1
Time spent: 2 hours
It's a basic tip calculator for a few different preset tip percents. 
Haven't done too much with layout and design, but I might take another look at it once I actually submit it. 

Version 2
Time spent: 4 hours
I went back and completely changed the design of the app. Now the tip button takes the user to a different window with a number of different tip options. 
Figuring out how to send data back and forth between different views was probably an uneccessary added difficulty for myself.

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

 * [x] Used multiple views
 * [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
