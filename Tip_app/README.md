Here is the first app for the iOS training course. 

Version 1 - 2 hours
It's a basic tip calculator for a few different preset tip percents. 
Haven't done too much with layout and design, but I might take another look at it once I actually submit it. 


Version 2 - 4 hours
I went back and completely changed the design of the app. Now the tip button takes the user to a different window with a number of different tip options. 
Figuring out how to send data back and forth between different views was probably an uneccessary added difficulty for myself.

Optional features used:
- bill amount is the first responder, keyboard auto-appears
- used multiple windows
